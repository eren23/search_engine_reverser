# Search Reverse Engineer

A very basic version of a tool that I thought could be useful, it's not fully functional, I might revisit it in the future.

The idea is that if you ask enough questions, you can learn how the search engine works.

Currently most of the analyzers are not implemented just mentioned in the code functions are empty.

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
python data_generator.py
```

```bash
python mock_search_server.py
```

```bash
python test_search_reverser.py
```
